## Implementation Notes

The entity filtering system works by:

1. Storing entity_id in all accounting records
2. Providing entity selection in the UI
3. Filtering API queries based on selected entity
4. Automatically assigning entity_id to new records

This allows users to view and manage data for specific entities within the accounting system.
